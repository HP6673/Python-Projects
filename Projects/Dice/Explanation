### Explanation of the Dice Program

**1. Importing the `random` module:**
```python
import random
```
- The `random` module is imported so that we can generate random numbers, which is essential for simulating the dice roll.

**2. Defining the `sentry` variable:**
```python
sentry = ""
```
- The `sentry` variable is initialized as an empty string. It's used as a flag to control the loop. The loop will keep running until `sentry` is not an empty string.

**3. Printing Welcome Message:**
```python
print("Welcome to the Dice Program")
print("-"*20)
```
- A welcoming message is printed, followed by a line of dashes for visual separation.

**4. While Loop:**
```python
while sentry == "":
```
- This `while` loop continues to run as long as `sentry` is an empty string. When the user decides to exit the program, `sentry` will be set to something other than an empty string.

**5. User Input:**
```python
sentry = input("Press Enter to roll the dice or type 'exit' to quit: ")
```
- The user is prompted to press Enter to roll the dice or type 'exit' to quit the program. The input is stored in the `sentry` variable.

**6. Dice Roll:**
```python
roll = random.randint(1, 6)
```
- The `random.randint(1, 6)` function generates a random integer between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll.

**7. Displaying the Roll Result:**
```python
print("Your roll is",roll)
print("-"*20)
```
- The result of the roll is displayed to the user, followed by another line of dashes.

**8. Exit Condition:**
```python
input("Press Enter to Exit")
```
- After the loop ends (when the user types 'exit'), the program waits for the user to press Enter before closing.
